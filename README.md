# Yamaha MusicCast official and unofficial REST API documentation

The 2 pdf files are official Yamaha MusicCast documents
The *.log file(s) show network sniffing of other APIs which are not covered in the official documents:
- [musiccast_playlist_management.log](https://github.com/adorobis/yamaha_musiccast/blob/main/musiccast_playlist_management.log) include 3 endpoints to list playlist names, list playlist content and play item from a playlist (the rest of the playlist will follow)
